    <h1>Rusty and Dino</h1>
    <p class="lead">
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a little robot named Rusty. Rusty was a curious and adventurous robot, always looking for new things to explore and discover.
</p>
<p class="lead">
One day, Rusty was out for a walk in the forest when he came across a big, friendly dinosaur named Dino. Dino was a little bit clumsy, but he was always eager to make new friends.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Rusty and Dino quickly became the best of friends, and they spent every day exploring the forest together. They climbed trees, chased butterflies, and played games of tag.
</p>
<p class="lead">
But one day, Rusty and Dino came across a big, scary obstacle. It was a giant, raging river, and there was no way to get across it.
</p>
<p class="lead">
Rusty and Dino were worried. They didn't know how they were going to get to the other side. But they didn't give up. They put their heads together and came up with a plan.
</p>
<p class="lead">
First, they gathered some sticks and branches and tied them together to make a raft. Then, they climbed aboard and paddled across the river with all their might.
</p>
<p class="lead">
It was a long and bumpy ride, but Rusty and Dino finally made it to the other side. They were so happy and proud of themselves for overcoming the obstacle.
</p>
<p class="lead">
From then on, Rusty and Dino were inseparable. They had many more adventures together and always stuck together, no matter what challenges came their way.
</p>
<p class="lead">
And so, Rusty and Dino lived happily ever after, exploring the wonders of the forest and having fun every day.
</p>
<p class="lead">
The end.
